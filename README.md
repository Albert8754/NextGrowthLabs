2.Here’s the list of reviews of Chrome apps - scraped from Playstore.  DataSet Link
Problem statement - There are times when a user writes Good, Nice App or any other positive text, in the review and gives 1-star rating. Your goal is to identify the reviews where the semantics of review text does not match rating. 

Your goal is to identify such ratings where review text is good, but rating is negative- so that the support team can point this to users. 
Deploy it using - Flask/Streamlit etc and share the live link.

3.Ranking Data - Understanding the co-relation between keyword rankings with description or any other attribute. Here’s the dataset. 
ans:

# Part 2
Check if the sentence is Grammatically correct: Please use any pre-trained model or use text from open datasets. Once done, please evaluate the English Grammar in the text column of the below dataset. 
DataSet Link
ans: Gramformer is the library used to find out if a sentance is correct or not.the error happened beacase of large loding time of data.

# More Bonus points
Write about any difficult problem that you solved. (According to us difficult - is something which 90% of people would have only 10% probability in getting a similarly good solution).
For me the assigment given by Nextgrowth was the toughest one done by me.

i have participated in Job A thon by Analytics Vidhya in Feb 2022.As per thier data more than 7500 candidates participated  and i have achived 467 rank that mean in top 10 percentage.
i have uploaded the code i have done

2.Formally, a vector space V' is a subspace of a vector space V if
V' is a vector space
every element of V′ is also an element of V.
Note that ordered pairs of real numbers (a,b) a,b∈R form a vector space V. Which of the following is a subspace of V?
The set of pairs (a, a + 1) for all real a
The set of pairs (a, b) for all real a ≥ b
The set of pairs (a, 2a) for all real a
The set of pairs (a, b) for all non-negative real a,b
