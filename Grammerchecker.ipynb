              " \"Hello. As a girl and a valid user of this platform, I am unhappy with your customer support deciding to PERMA ban my account based on one small community guideline breach, that was NOT expected, at all. See, since you advertise Instagram links on your platform, it came to my mind that I could just POST a small Twitch link in my bio. However, you guys said that that is such a HUGE community guideline BREACH that you just can't unban my account, and your front support desk THREATENED ME that if I even make another account with another PHONE NUMBER I will get banned again. Does this sound valid to you? I've used thousands of apps, and none of them had such harsh penalties for one small guideline breach, rather they would just inform you that you can't post links there. First, you did not make it clear at all, and second you're perma banning people just because of their lack of knowledge. I just want to say that any normal user like me would never bother reading guidelines, to say the least, and second, if you've just informed me that I've breached the ToS, I would never do it again. That's how Instagram works. They warn their users, because they CARE about their user's lives. You clearly DO NOT CARE because all you're in for is the money and treating people like TRASH. Now, since I am a Business woman myself, I will suggest your management team investigates this, since I believe this mistake was probably your POOR support desk's work, but if noone sends this matter to your management, I would be happy to find it myself, and have a little talk. :) Thanks!\",\n",
